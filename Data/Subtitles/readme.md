## Subtitles Data

Subtitles data is crawled from the YouTube video lecture subtitles. Specifically, we crawl the Hindi and Bengali subtitles for each lecture video.

We crawled lecture subtitles from NPTEL (CS and AI domains) and MIT OCW (CS domains).

Due to the file size limitations, we have uploaded data externally, which can be accessed at: [GDrive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e4PeUZpLFj4az2JDpQZA37T5CXcbaJMi?usp=sharing)
